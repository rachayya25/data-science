    "1. What is the relationship between def statements and lambda expressions ?\n",
    "\n",
    "def statement is used to create a normal function. where as lamba expressions are used to create Anonymous functions. which can be assigned to a variable and can be called using the variable later in function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda's body is a single expression and not a block of statements like def statement. The lambda expression's body is similar to what we'd put in a def body's return statement. We simply type the result as an expression instead of explicitly returning it. Because it is limited to an expression, a lambda is less general than a def statement."

    "2. What is the benefit of lambda?\n",
    "A lambda expression is an inline code that implements a functional interface without creating a concrete or anonymous class. A lambda expression is basically an anonymous method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fewer Lines of Code − One of the most benefits of a lambda expression is to reduce the amount of code. We know that lambda expressions can be used only with a functional interface. For instance, Runnable is a functional interface, so we can easily apply lambda expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequential and Parallel execution support by passing behavior as an argument in methods − By using Stream API in Java 8, the functions are passed to collection methods. Now it is the responsibility of collection for processing the elements either in a sequential or parallel manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher Efficiency − By using Stream API and lambda expressions, we can achieve higher efficiency (parallel execution) in case of bulk operations on collections. Also, lambda expression helps in achieving the internal iteration of collections rather than external iteration."
